# The collection DTD

*collection_1_0.dtd* shows the latest XML document type definition for reading and writing *.pwc* files.

Since the XML parser used with *novelyst_collection* is not validating, the DTD is not associated with *.pwc* files by a DOCTYPE statement. 

The DTD file provided here is for information only. However, the DTD major and minor version numbers are used as an element attribute, so any application can use them for compatibility checks.
